Hello! Welcome to my first ever README file, hopefully of many. Here you will skim a brief description of homework challenge #1, completed as part of an edX coding bootcamp. Enjoy!

# Challenge 01: HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Changes Made

This week's challenge was to refactor an existing webpage in order to make it more accessible and to improve it's SEO; curious as it was a website for an agency that claims they can improve your SEO. I guess that's none of my business.

So, I added alt tags to all the images, and decided to move one image from CSS to the html doc so that I could add an alt tag to it. I get that we're learning to do more in CSS, but I wouldn't want anyone using a screen reader to *not* hear about the stock image of 4 coworkers pretending to know what they're doing... how relatable. Given the many div tags, I did not know how to refactor the html.

The second thing I tackled was the CSS file. First, I reordered it to compliment the html doc. Conveniently, several of the header sections, as well as the image sections, had identical attributes. I therefore combined them via a CSS Selectors List. Delightfully concise. As satisfying as this was, once again, I am not sure if I completely defactored the CSS document. 

## Acceptance Criteria 

Is the code cleaner? Maybe. It is shorter. Kindof... I did add a few meta tags to the header of the html document for SEO purposes (refer to Kermit meme above). Regarding the rest of the acceptance criteria for this challenge, 
    - Elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, yes
    - Icon and image elements have alt attributes, yes
    - Heading attributes fall in sequential order, yes
    - Title element is concise and descriptive, yes
