Hello! Welcome to my first ever README file, hopefully of many. Here you will skim a brief description of homework challenge #1, completed as part of an edX coding bootcamp. Enjoy!

# Challenge 01: HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Changes Made

This week's challenge was to refactor an existing webpage in order to make it more accessible, improve it's SEO, and better the codebase... while leaving the page's appearance unchanged.

To achieve this, I first added alt tags to all the images, and decided to move one image from CSS to the html doc so that I could add an alt tag to it. I tried to make some of the div tags in the html document semantic, to help make its structure less confusing.

The second thing I tackled was the CSS file. First, I reordered it to compliment the html doc. Conveniently, several of the header sections, as well as the image sections, had identical attributes. I therefore combined them via a CSS Selectors List. Delightfully concise. As satisfying as this was, I am not sure if I completely defactored the CSS and HTML documents. tbd.

As you can see from the screen snips below, the website integrity is maintained:

## Acceptance Criteria 

Is the code cleaner? Maybe. It is shorter. Kind-of... I did add a few meta tags to the header of the html document for SEO purposes. Regarding the rest of the acceptance criteria for this challenge, 
    - Elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, yes
    - Icon and image elements have alt attributes, yes
    - Heading attributes fall in sequential order, yes
    - Title element is concise and descriptive, yes
